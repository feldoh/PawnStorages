Homebound - An experimental mod offering a variety of ways to tuck pawns away when they're not needed in order to preserve system resources

## Features
* Create faux housing for pawns and schedule when they go "home".
* Pawns will rest while at "home" and leave again when they're scheduled for another task.
* Includes a number of WIP experimental ways to store pawns. This includes digitizing them, storing them in a magic crystal, or keeping them visible as statues.
* Can be used to keep larger groups of pawns out of the way, while maintaining their ability to do their jobs when needed. Build a barracks for your army, a neighborhood for your farmers, store a noteworthy pawn for later, and more.
* Can store prisoners in statues for later.


## Details
* Build a pawn door, assign it to a pawn, and schedule when they should be at home.
* Construct magical gems or digitizer discs and store noteworthy pawns for later without hogging system resources.
* Create larger populations in your colony and, with a bit of creative scheduling, decide who is active and when.


## FAQ
>Isn't this a bit unbalanced?

It is, which is why it's marked as an experimental mod. We want to bring great new ways to play to Rimworld, and we believe allowing for larger colonies as well as creative pawn storage solutions is a good start.

## Building and Releasing
You do not need to build the project to use it, however, building the release configuration will create a zip file for nice distribution.
